Our C++ Project - a mini Netflix!
For our project, we'll be building a movie/series management app.
The user will be able to browse and watch their favorite media content within the application.
The manager will be able to add new media or remove existing media from the database.
By the end of this project we will be the ultimate masters of C++ programming.

Let's do this!

How To Access The Program:

1. Click on the green "Code" button
2. Download the ZIP file and extract it
3. Open the "Media App" folder
4. Run BambaFlix.exe
